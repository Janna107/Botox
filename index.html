  <p> Instead of correcting already-formed wrinkles, preventative injections - affectionately named “Baby Botox” - supposedly stop deep wrinkles from forming to begin with. Social media is the largest driver of the popularization of Baby Botox in recent years. The <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/decade-in-review/the-age-of-instagram-face">“Instagram Face”</a> is the desired face of the future.</p>
  <p>
    While the largest <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bHE_SRwxNRGGx4p8V7OO6NInKTDBzvoOJuzp6lgvoh4/edit#gid=297213801">age-group</a> to use Botulinum Toxin Type A today remains those ages 40-54, the number of women aged between 19 and 34 having the cosmetic procedure has risen by 41% since 2011, according to the <a href="https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/plastic-surgery-statistics">American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery.</a>
  </p>
  <p>
  “Patients have become more transparent and comfortable in sharing their journeys. And with that shift, plastic surgery now enjoys greater social awareness and open dialogue,” said Gregory A. Greco, president of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.

    <h3><center> Botox and the Pandemic </center></h3>
  <p> There was a steep decline in the number of Botox procedures in 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the obvious causes were stay-at-home orders and closures of non-essential businesses, new data gathered reveals that the pandemic may have boosted the growth of the injectables.
  </p>
  <p>The number of Botulinum Toxin Type A procedures saw a 73% growth in procedures in 2022 from pre-pandemic figures.
    </p>
  <p>There are several theories as to why:</p>

  <ol type="1">
       <li> Roughly 94% of Botox users are women, so funneling advertising dollars into social media and influencer marketing targets younger and younger women to seek Botox injections.</li>
       <li> The “Zoom Boom.” Patients of all ages working remotely report feeling unhappy about how they look over zoom. </li>
       <li> Patients wish to look younger after aging from pandemic stress. They feel ready to pull the trigger on aesthetic procedures they held off on during the pandemic.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><center> The Big Picture </center></h3>
  <p> The <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/anti-aging-market">anti-aging market<a/>
    - which includes injectables, fillers, hair coloring, and stretch mark treatment- saw a 7.9% compound annual growth rate from 2021 ($60.4 billion) to 2022 (64.9 billion). At this rate of rapid growth, the anti-aging target is expected to climb to $106.3 billion by 2030.
  </p>
  <p>Feminist sociologist and author Dana Berkowitz warns young women interested in the injectables of the ultimate “emotional labor” they may undergo from beginning an anti-aging regimen that requires constant up-keeping and upgrading of a youthful appearance… not to mention thousands of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>“The problem for me is that in targeting younger women the doctors are trying to create this lifetime consumer,” said Berkowitz, in an interview with The Guardian.
